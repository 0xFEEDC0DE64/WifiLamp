## Software components
1. There is the code running on the micro controller. The code is [here](/WifiLamp.ino). I compiled it using the Arduino IDE. There is some setup needed to get it running on ESP2866. I don't know how to set it up anymore. I also implemented some remote update functionality to apply updates via WiFi.
2. I could not fit the switch on/off images into the firmware, so I moved them to a CDN apache webserver in my LAN. The contents of the cdn are [here](/cdn/).
3. To control my light using a (free) amazon dash button, i have a small nodejs script running inside a 256MB Ram ubuntu vm on my home server. The code is [here](/amzn-dash-lamp.js). I hate scripting languages like JavaScript and I have no clue how to get it running on your machine. There is a dependency to the amazon dash button library. I don't know how to install it. That's why I have a VM that I can backup!
